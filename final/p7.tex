\def \bsat { \textsc{bal-sat}}
\begin{problem}
  A \emph{balanced assignment} to the boolean variable $x_1 \ldots x_{2n}$
  is one where exactly $n$ of the variables are assigned \True and
  the rest are assigned \False.
  Define the language
  \[ 
    \bsat := \set{ \vector{\phi} : \phi(x_1 \ldots x_{2n}) \text{ is a cnf formula
    and $\exists$ a balanced assignment that satisfies $\phi$}}.
  \]
  Prove that $\bsat$ is \sfNP-complete.
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  That $\bsat$ can be solved in \sfNP: guess an assignment
  and check if it satisfies the formula and is balanced.

  \step
  Reduction of \SAT to \bsat:

  \step
  $T$ = ``On input $\vector{\phi}$, where $\phi(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$
    is a cnf formula:
    \begin{enumarabic}
      \item Initialize a new formula $\psi$
        with all the logical expressions in $\phi$.
      \item For $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$:
        \begin{enumarabic*}
          \item Define a new variable $x_{i+n}$.
          \item Add the clause $(x_{n+i} \lor \neg x_{n+i})$ to $\psi$.
        \end{enumarabic*}
        \item Return $\vector{\psi}$.''
    \end{enumarabic}

  \begin{align*}
    \vector{\phi} \in \SAT &\Iff \exists \text{ an assignment to $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ that satisfies $\phi$} \\
      &\Iff \exists \text{ an assignment to $\phi$ with $k \leq n$ variables assigned \True, that satisfies $\phi$} \\
      &\Iff \exists \text{ an assignment to $\psi$ with $k$ variables from $\phi$ assigned \True that satisfies $\psi$} \\
      &\Iff \exists \text{an assignment to $\psi$ with $n$ original variables from
      $\phi$ assigned \True and $n-k$ new variables assigned \True}. \\
      &\Iff \vector{\psi} \in \bsat
  \end{align*}
