\begin{Answer}
  The most interesting thing I learned in CS-39 was the concept of undecidability
  and \sfP vs. \sfNP. I feel proud that I can reason about computation
  in a more abstract and formal way and, for instance, see/prove
  that some problems are \sfNP-complete and cannot be solved in polynomial time.
