\begin{problem}
  For a string $w \in \set{0, 1}^*$, let $\beta(w)$ denote the integer
  obtained by interpreting $w$ as a binary number.  For example,
  $\beta(0011) = 3$. We also define $\beta(\eps) = 0$.
  Define the following language over the alphabet $\set{0, 1, \#}$:
  \[ L_1 := \set{x\#y : x, y \in \set{0, 1}^* \text{ and } \beta(x) < \beta(y)}. \]
  Determine, with proof, whether or not $L_1$ is context-free.
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  $L_1$ is not context-free.

  \step
  Suppose it is, then by the pumping lemma for context-free grammars,
  there exists some minimum pumping length $p$ such that for all strings
  $w \in L_1$ with $\abs{w} \geq p$, there exists a decomposition
  $w = uvxyz$ such that;
  \begin{enumroman}
    \item $\abs{vxy} \leq p$
    \item $\abs{vy} > 0$
    \item $uv^kwy^kz \in L_1$ for all $k \geq 0$
  \end{enumroman}

  \step
  Pick $s = 10^p\#0^p110^p$. Clearly, $s \in L_1$ since $\beta(10^p) < \beta(0^p110^p)$.
  Write $s = uvwyz$. There are three possibilities for $wyz$:
  \begin{enumroman}
    \item If $vwy$ is to the left of the $\#$ symbol, then pumping up the string
      disproportionately increases the value of the string to the left, and breaks
      the condition that.
    \item If $vwy$ is to the right of the $\#$ symbol, then pumping down the string
      decreases the value of the string to the right, and breaks the condition.
    \item If $vwy$ is at the boundary (i.e. $vwy$ contains the $\#$ symbol), then there
      are two possibilities:
      \begin{enumroman}
        \item If $\#$ occurs in $w$, then if $\abs{v} > 0$, pumping up the string
          increases the value of the string to the left, and breaks the condition.
        
        \item If $\#$ does not occur in $w$, then pumping down the string removes the
          $\#$ symbol, hence the result cannot be in $L_1$.
      \end{enumroman}
  \end{enumroman}


\end{Answer}
