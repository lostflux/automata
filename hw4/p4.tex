\begin{problem}
  A string $x \in \Sigma^*$ is called a \emph{square}
  if $x = w^2$ for some $w \in \Sigma^*$.
  Let $L_{sq} = \set{w^2 : w \in \set{0, 1}^*}$.
  Consider its complement:
  \[ \overline{L}_{sq} =
    \set{x \in \set{0, 1}^* : x
      \text{
        is not of the form $w^2$ for any $w \in \set{0, 1}^*$
      }
    }.
  \]

  \step
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Prove that every even-length string is in $\overline{L}_{sq}$
      can be decomposed as $x = uv$ where the middle symbol of $u$
      differs from the middle symbol of $v$.
    \item Using this property, design a context-free grammar that
      generates $\overline{L}_{sq}$.
  \end{enumalph}
