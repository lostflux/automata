\begin{problem}
  For each of the following languages, decide whether it is regular
  or not. If it is regular, give a finite automaton or a regular expression for it.
  If is is not regular, use any combination of
  the pumping lemma, closure properties, or results \emph{proved} in class.

  \begin{enumalph}
    \item $L_1 = \set{0^m 1^n 0^{m + n} : m, n \geq 0}$.
    \item $L_2 = \set{xwx^R : x, w \in \set{0, 1}^*, \abs{x} > 0 \text{ and } \abs{y} > 0}$.
    \item $L_3 = \set{0^m 1^n : m \text{ divides } n}$.
    \item $L_4 = \set{0^n 1^p : n \le 4 \text{ or $p$ is prime (or both)}}$.
    \item The infinite union $\bigcup_{n \geq 1}^\infty A_i$, where each $A_i$
      is a regular language.
      \emph{
        The question should be interpreted as asking
        whether the union is \textbf{guaranteed} to be regular
        no matter how the sets $A_i$ are chosen.
      }
    \item The infinite intersection $\bigcap_{n \geq 1}^\infty A_i$, where each $A_i$
      is a regular language.
      \emph{
        The question should be interpreted as asking
        whether the intersection is \textbf{guaranteed} to be regular
        no matter how the sets $A_i$ are chosen.
      }
