\begin{problem}
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Draw a $3$-state DFA for the language
    \[
      D_3 = \set{ x \in \set{0, 1}^* :
      \beta(x) \text{ is divisible by } 3},
    \]
    where $\beta(x)$ is the string $x$ interpreted as a
    binary number.
    \begin{Answer}

    \item Convert the DFA into a regular expression
      using the $R_{ij}^k$ method.

      \step
      To do this systematically,
      make a big table with $9$ rows indexed by the pairs $(i, j)$
      and $4$ columns indexed by the possible values of $k \in \set{0, 1, 2, 3}$.
      Fill each cell of the table with a regular expression that generates
      the corresponding $R_{ij}^k$.
      Sometimes, youâ€™ll obtain a complicated regular expression if you directly
      apply the equations from class. In such cases, show what the equations give you
      and only then simplify. You may use the shorthand $X+$ to denote $XX^\ast$,
      where $X$ is an arbitrary regular expression.
