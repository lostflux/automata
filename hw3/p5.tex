\begin{problem}
  Now, apply the notion of left equivalence to the theory
  of regular languages.

  \begin{enumalph}
    \item For a language $A$ over alphabet $\Sigma$ and a string $x \in \Sigma$,
      let $[x]_A$ denote the equivalence class (of $A$) to which $x$ belongs.
      For instance, consider the set $X_1 = (01)^*, X_2 = (01)^*0$,
      and $X_3 = \set{0, 1}^* - (X_1 \cup X_2)$, then:
      \begin{enumroman}
        \item $[010]_{B}$ denotes the set $X_2$,
        \item $[01010]_{B}$ also denotes the same set $X_2$, and
        \item $[\eps]_B$ and $[0101]_B$ both denote the set $X_1$.
      \end{enumroman}

      \step
      There are rarely one unique way way to write an equivalence class
      $[x]_A$ --- there are usually multiple choices for $x$.
      These choices are called \emph{representatives}
      of the equivalence class.

      \step
      Prove that for any $x \in \Sigma^*$ and $a \in \Sigma$,
      the class $[xa]_A$ is completely determined by the class $[x]_A$
      and the alphabet symbol $A$ ---
      that is, prove that the particular $x$ we pick as a representative
      for the class $[x]_A$ is inconsequential.

      \end{Answer}

    \item Suppose a language $A$ over alphabet $\Sigma$ has finitely many
      equivalence classes; $[x_1]_A, [x_2]_A, \ldots, [x_n]_A$ for some
      $n \ge 1$. Prove that $A$ is regular.
