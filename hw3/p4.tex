\begin{problem}
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item
    For a language $A$ over alphabet $\Sigma$, define
    the relation $\equiv_A$ on strings in $\Sigma^*$ as follows:
    ``$x \equiv_A y$'' means:
    \[ \forall w \in \Sigma^* (xw \in A \Iff yw \in A). \]
    \step
    Formally (and concisely) prove that $\equiv_A$ is an equivalence relation.
    \begin{Answer}
      If $\equiv_A$ is an equivalence relation,
      then it must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
      \begin{enumroman}
        \item \textbf{Reflexivity:}
        \item \textbf{Symmetry:}
        \item \textbf{Transitivity:}
      \end{enumroman}
    \end{Answer}
    
    \newpage
    \item The equivalence $\equiv_A$ is called the
      \emph{left equivalence relation} of the language $A$.
      An equivalence relation on a set partitions the set into
      disjoint subsets called equivalence classes
      in the following way: two elements belong to the same
      class iff they are related by the equivalence relation.
      Thus, $\equiv_A$, which is a relation on $\Sigma^*$,
      partitions $\Sigma^*$ into equivalence classes:
      these are called the left equivalence classes of the language $A$.

      \step
      For example, consider the language
      $C = \set{x \in {0,1}^* : \abs{x} \text{is even}}$ 
      over the alphabet $\set{0,1}$.
      Convince yourself that any two even-length strings
      are related by $\equiv_C$, as are any two odd-length strings.
      Also, no odd-length string is related by $\equiv_C$ 
      to an even-length string.
      Thus, $C$ has exactly two left equivalence classes:
      (1) odd-length strings, i.e., $\set{0, 1}^* - C$,
      and (2) even-length strings, i.e., $C$.

      \step
      Similarly, convince yourself that the language $B = (01)^*$
      over the alphabet $\set{0, 1}$ has three equivalence classes,
      which are:
      (1) $B$,
      (2) $(01)^*0$, and
      (3) $\set{0, 1}^* - (B \cup (01)^*0)$.

      \step
      Describe the left equivalence classes of each of the following
      languages (no proofs required):
      \begin{enumroman}
        \item $L_1 = \set{a, aa, aaa, b, ba, baa}$ over the alphabet $\set{a, b}$.
        \item $L_2 = a*b*c*$ over the alphabet $\set{a, b, c}$.
        \item $L_3 = (ab \cup ba)^*$ over the alphabet $\set{a, b}$.
        \item $L_4 = \set{0^n1^n : n \geq 0}$ over the alphabet $\set{0, 1}$.
      \end{enumroman}
