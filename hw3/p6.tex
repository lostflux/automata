\begin{problem}
  The connection between left equivalence and regularity is even deeper.
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Let $A$ be a regular language over alphabet $\Sigma$.
      Prove (formally and rigorously) that $A$ has finitely many
      distinct left equivalence classes.
      The function $\delta^*$ we defined in class might be useful.
      \begin{Answer}
        
      \end{Answer}
    
    \item Using one or more of the results proved above, give alternate
      proofs that the following languages are not regular:
      \begin{enumroman}
        \item $\set{0^n1^n : n \ge 0}$.
          \begin{Answer}

          \end{Answer}
        \item $\set{x \in \set{0, 1}^8 : x = x^R}$.
