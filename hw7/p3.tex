\begin{problem}
  Sloppy Q. Thinker and Fawlty J. Logician are two computer science
  amateurs who have not taken a rigorous course in the Theory of Computation,
  such as Dartmouthâ€™s CS 39.
  They have come up with the following fallacious ``proofs.''

  Criticize each of these fallacious ``proofs'' thoroughly.
  How would you convince Sloppy and Fawlty that not only are they wrong,
  but ideas along these lines simply cannot work for proving what they are claiming?

  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Sloppy has this ``proof'' that $P \neq NP$.
      Consider an algorithm for \SAT:
      ``On input $\phi$, try all possible assignments to the variables.
      Accept if any satisfy $\phi$.''
      This algorithm clearly requires exponential time.
      Thus, \SAT has exponential time complexity.
      Therefore \SAT is not in $P$.
      Because \SAT is in $NP$, it must be the case that $P \neq NP$.
    \item Fawlty instead has a ``proof'' that $P = NP$.
      Take an arbitrary language $l \in NP$.
      Let $N$ be a polynomial-time NDTM decider for $L$.
      Since NDTMs are equivalent to TMs, there is a deterministic TM, $M$,
      that also decides $L$.
      This shows that $L \in P$. Therefore $NP \subseteq P$.
      Since we clearly have $P \subseteq NP$, it follows that $P = NP$.
