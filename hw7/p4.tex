\begin{problem}
  Let $\DSAT = \set{ \vector{\phi} : \phi \text{ is a cnf with at least $2$ satisfying assignments} }$.
  Prove that $\DSAT$ is NP-complete.
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  \step
  $\DSAT$ is in NP:
    Given a cnf $\phi$, we can check if $\phi$ is in \DSAT
    using a non-deterministic TM $T$ as follows:

    \step
    $T_1$ = ``On input $\vector{\phi}$, where $\phi$ is a cnf:
      \begin{enumarabic}
        \item Guess two assignments $A_1$ and $A_2$ to the variables in $\phi$.
        \item If $A_1 \neq A_2$ and both $A_1$ and $A_2$ satisfy $\phi$, \Accept.''
      \end{enumarabic}

  \bigskip
  $\DSAT$ is NP-complete.
    Consider the following reduction of \SAT to \DSAT:

    \step
    $T_2$ = ``On input $\vector{\phi}$, where $\phi$ is a cnf:
      \begin{enumarabic}
        \item Define a new variable $\gamma$ that does not occur in $\phi$.
        \item  Construct a new cnf $\phi' = \phi \land (\gamma \lor \lnot \gamma)$.
        \item \Return $\vector{\phi'}$.''
      \end{enumarabic}

    \step
    \begin{align*}
      \phi \in \SAT &\Iff \exists \text{ at least one assignment that satisfies $\phi$
                          (let $A$ be one such assignment)}. \\
                    &\Iff \exists \text{ at least two assignments that satisfy $\phi'$,
                          $B = A \cup \set{\gamma = T}$, and 
                          $C = A \cup \set{\gamma = F}$}.\\
                    &\Iff \phi' \in \DSAT
    \end{align*}

    \step
    $\SAT$ is NP-complete, and so must $\DSAT$ be.
    If it were not, then clearly having an efficient algorithm for \DSAT
    would give a plausible and efficient way to derive solutions to \SAT,
    contradicting the fact that \SAT is proven to be NP-complete.
