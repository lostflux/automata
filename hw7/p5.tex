\begin{problem}
  Prove that if $P$ were equal to $NP$, then there would exist
  an efficient (i.e. deterministic polynomial-time) algorithm
  to break the RSA cryptosystem.

  \step
  \grey{
    Hint: You can solve this problem even if you havenâ€™t studied
    the RSA cryptosystem before. Here is all you need to know about RSA.
    The RSA scheme involves a modulus of the form $N = pq$
    where $p$ and $q$ are $n$-bit prime numbers, for some large $n$.
    The value of $N$ is known to the world, but the factorization into
    $p$ and $q$ is secret. If an adversary figures out the factorization,
    they can decrypt any messages that were encrypted with the modulus $N$.
  }
\end{problem}

\begin{Answer}
  Given an integer $N$ that is guaranteed to be the product of two primes $p$ and $q$,
  the problem of finding $p$ and $q$ is in the class NP as it can be solved
  non-deterministically with the following NDTM:

  \step
  $T$ = ``On input $N$, where $N = pq$ for some (unknown) primes $p$ and $q$:
    \begin{enumarabic}
      \item Non-deterministically guess two integers $p \in (1, N)$ and $q \in (1, N)$.
      \item If $p \cdot q = N$, \Return $\vector{p, q}$.''
    \end{enumarabic}

  \step
  Thus, $T$ \emph{non-deterministically} finds the factorization of $N$ in polynomial time.
  If $P = NP$, then there exists some \emph{deterministic} turing machine that can also
  find $p$ and $q$ in polynomial time, hence determine the factorization for any
  RSA number $N$ and, using the factorization, decrypt any RSA-encrypted message
  encrypted with the modulus $N$.

\end{Answer}
