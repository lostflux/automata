\begin{problem}
  For each $x \in \set{0, 1}^*$, define $\text{grow}(x)$ to be the string
  obtained by replacing every occurrence of `$0$' in $x$ with `$00$'.
  For example:
  \[ 
          \text{grow}(10110) = 1001100,
    \quad \text{grow}(000) = 000000,
    \quad \text{grow}(\eps) = \eps,
    \quad \text{grow}(11) = 11.
  \]
  Let $P = (Q, \set{0, 1}, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, F0)$ be a PDA.
  Formally describe a PDA that recognizes $\set{\text{grow}(x) : x \in \calL(P)}$.
  Do not assume anything about the design of $P$. \\
  Give a high-level explanation of your construction
  (no formal completeness and soundness proofs are required).
