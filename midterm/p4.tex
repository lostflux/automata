\begin{problem}
  For each $x \in \set{0, 1}^*$, define $\text{grow}(x)$ to be the string
  obtained by replacing every occurrence of `$0$' in $x$ with `$00$'.
  For example:
  \[ 
          \text{grow}(10110) = 1001100,
    \quad \text{grow}(000) = 000000,
    \quad \text{grow}(\eps) = \eps,
    \quad \text{grow}(11) = 11.
  \]
  Let $P = (Q, \set{0, 1}, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, F)$ be a PDA.
  Formally describe a PDA that recognizes $\set{\text{grow}(x) : x \in \calL(P)}$.
  Do not assume anything about the design of $P$. \\
  Give a high-level explanation of your construction
  (no formal completeness and soundness proofs are required).
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  Define a new PDA
  \[ P_2 = (Q_2, \set{0, 1}, \Gamma, \delta_2, q_0, F) \]
  where:
  \begin{align*}
    Q_2 &= \bigcup_{q \in Q} \set{q, q'} \\
    \delta_2(q, x, \gamma) &= \begin{cases}
      \delta(q, x, \gamma) &\text{ if $q \in Q$ and $x \ne 0$} \\
      r' &\text{ where $r = \delta(q, x, \gamma)$, if $q \in Q$ and $x = 0$} \\
      r &\text{ if $q = r'$ for some $r \in Q$, and $x = 0$, $\gamma = \eps$}
    \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  \textbf{Main Idea:}
  \begin{enumroman}
    \item $P_2$ starts at the same state as $P$.
      $P_2$ also uses the same accepting states as $P$.
    \item $P_2$ contains a duplicate state $q'$ for each state $q \in Q$.
    \item Whenever there is an incoming transition $p \to q$ with a reading $x = 0$,
      $P_2$ instead transition to $q'$. $q'$ then only transitions to $q$ if the next
      symbol is a $0$.
      The transition from $p$ to $q'$ pushes to or pops from the stack as
      it would if transitioning directly from $p$ to $q$ in the original PDA.
      However, the transition from $q'$ to $q$ does not push to or pop from the stack,
      thus ensuring the stack remains consistent with that of the original
      PDA on the original string (single $0$ transition).
    \item All other transitions are handled the same way as in the original PDA.
  \end{enumroman}
