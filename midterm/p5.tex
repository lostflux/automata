\def \uniq { \textsc{unique} }
\begin{problem}
  For a language $L$, define
  $\uniq(L) := \set{x \in L : \nexists y \in L
  \text{ such that } \abs{y} = \abs{x}}$. \\
  In other words, $\uniq(L)$ is the set of all strings $x \in L$
  such that $x$ is the only string in $L$ that has length $\abs{x}$.

  \step
  Is the class of regular languages closed under the operation $\uniq$?
