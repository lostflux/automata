\begin{problem}
  Every language falls into into one of the following three categories:
  \begin{enumroman}
    \item regular
    \item context-free but not regular
    \item not context-free
  \end{enumroman}
  Which of these categories is the following language in?

  \[
    L_6 = \set{ x \in \set{0, 1}^* : \exists y, z \in \set{0, 1}^*
    \text{ such that } x = yz, \abs{y} = \abs{z},
    \text{ and $\beta(y) \equiv 0 \pmod 3 $}}.
  \]
  \emph{Reminder:} For a string $x \in \set{0, 1}^*$, $\beta(x)$ is the
  string $x$ interpreted as a binary number.
  For instance, $\beta(11001) = 25$ and $\beta(0011) = 3$.
  We also define $\beta(\eps) = 0$.
