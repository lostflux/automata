\begin{problem}
  Show that a k-tape TM $M$ can be simulated by a single-tape TM $M'$
  in such a way that a computation that takes time $t$
  (i.e., $t$ steps of one configuration yielding another)
  on $M$ takes time $O(t^2)$ on $M'$.
  The big-O notation may hide a constant that depends on $k$.
  You may assume that $t \geq \abs{x}$, where $x$ is the input to $M$.
\end{problem}
