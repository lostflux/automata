\CreditStatement{
  All the work on this PSET is my own.
  I usually discuss ideas with Paul Shin, but this weekend
  we were both busy and couldn't meet to discuss ideas.
  We only chatted about all the different things we had tried
  out on question 2.2. (and none of them had worked yet).

  \step
  I also referred to the following books:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction to the Theory of Computation} by \textbf {Michael Sipser}.
    \item \textbf{A Mathematical Introduction to Logic} by \textbf {Herbert Enderton}.
  \end{enumerate}

\cfoot{\thepage}                        % set page-numbers in footer.
\lhead{\textit{\textbf{ Amittai, S}}}   % set name in header, left.
