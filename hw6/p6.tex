\begin{problem}
  All of the automata models we have studied in this course allow 
  ``useless'' states, i.e., states which are never entered in any run.
  It would be nice to have an algorithm that could detect and prune
  such useless states in an automaton, but this is not always possible!
  Define the languages
  \begin{align*}
    \Udfa = \set{\vector{M} :
      \text{$M$ is a DFA and $M$ has at least one useless state}}, \\
    \Upda = \set{\vector{M} :
      \text{$M$ is a PDA and $M$ has at least one useless state}}, \\
    \Utm = \set{\vector{M} :
      \text{$M$ is a TM and $M$ has at least one useless state}}.
  \end{align*}
  
  \step
  Prove that $\Utm$ is undecidable.
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}

  \begin{claim}
    \label{claim:tm-undecidable}
    $\Utm$ is undecidable.

    \step
    \begin{proof}
      Suppose $\Utm$ is decidable, that means there exists some TM
      $M_0$ that, given any turing machine $\vector{M}$, can decide whether
      $M$ has a useless state.

      \step
      Construct a TM $M_1$ deciding the complement of $\Utm$ as follows:

      \step
      $M_1$ = ``On input $\vector{M}$ where $M$ is a TM:
        \begin{enumarabic}
          \item Run $M_0$ on $\vector{M}$.
          \item If $M_0$ accepts $\vector{M}$, \Reject.
          \item If $M_0$ rejects $\vector{M}$, \Accept.''
        \end{enumarabic}

      \step
      $M_1$'s decision always differs with $M_0$'s decision, so if $M_0$ decides $\Utm$,
      then $M_1$ the set of all TMs without a useless state.

      \step
      Since turing machines always have an accepting state,
      then every turing machine with an empty language always has \emph{at least}
      one useless state (the accepting state).
      
      \newpage
      $M_2$ = ``On input $\vector{M}$ where $M$ is a TM:
        \begin{enumarabic}
          \item Run $M_1$ on $\vector{M}$.
          \item If $M_1$ accepts $M$, then $M$ has no useless states,
            hence $M$ accepts some string in its input language. \Accept.
          \item If $M_1$ rejects $M$, then $M$ has \crim{at least one} useless state.
            Do the following:
            \begin{enumarabic*}
              \item Suppose $Q$ is the set of states of $M$,
                and $q_f$ the accepting state in $M$.
              \item For every possible subset $S \subseteq Q \setminus \set{q_f}$:
              \begin{enumarabic*}
                \item Delete $S$ from $M$ to create a new turing machine $M'$.
                \item Run $M_1$ on $\vector{M'}$.
                \item If $M_1$ accepts $M'$, \Accept.
                \item If $M_1$ rejects $M'$, then continue to the next subset
              \end{enumarabic*}
              \item If $M_1$ rejects every such $M'$, then none of the subsets of
              \item $2^{Q \setminus \set{q_f}}$ contained all the useless states in
                $M$, meaning $q_f$ must be a useless state. \Reject.''
            \end{enumarabic*}
        \end{enumarabic}

        \bigskip
        $M_2$ only accepts input $\vector{M}$ if the accepting state
        in $M$ is not a useless state. Therefore, $M_2$ decides the complement of
        $\textsf{E}_{\textsf{TM}}$.
        This implies that the complement of $\textsf{E}_{\textsf{TM}}$ is decidable,
        hence $\textsf{E}_{\textsf{TM}}$ is decidable.
        But we proved that $\Etm$ is, in fact undecidable, so this result creates
        a contradiction, meaning the initial assumption that $\Utm$
        is decidable must be wrong and $\Utm$ is undecidable.
      \end{proof}
