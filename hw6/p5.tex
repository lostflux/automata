\begin{problem}
  All of the automata models we have studied in this course allow 
  ``useless'' states, i.e., states which are never entered in any run.
  It would be nice to have an algorithm that could detect and prune
  such useless states in an automaton, but this is not always possible!
  Define the languages
  \begin{align*}
    \Udfa = \set{\vector{M} :
      \text{$M$ is a DFA and $M$ has at least one useless state}}, \\
    \Upda = \set{\vector{M} :
      \text{$M$ is a PDA and $M$ has at least one useless state}}, \\
    \Utm = \set{\vector{M} :
      \text{$M$ is a TM and $M$ has at least one useless state}}.
  \end{align*}
  
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Prove that $\Udfa$ is decidable.
    
    \item Prove that $\Upda$ is decidable.
  \end{enumalph}
\end{problem}
