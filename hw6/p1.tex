\begin{problem}
  We remarked in class that decidable languages are closed under
  (a) union, (b) intersection, (c) complement, (d) concatenation, and
  (e) Kleene star.  Prove the following.
  \begin{enumalph}
    \setcounter{enumi}{1}
    \item intersection
    \begin{Answer}
      Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be TMs deciding $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively.
      Construct a TM $T$ deciding $L_1 \cap L_2$ as follows:
      
      \step
      $T$ = ``On input $w$:
        \begin{enumarabic}
          \item Simulate $T_1$ on input $w$.
          \item If $T_1$ rejects, \Reject.
          \item If $T_1$ accepts, simulate $T_2$ on input $w$.
          \item If $T_2$ accepts, \Accept;
                if $T_2$ rejects, \Reject.''
        \end{enumarabic}
      
        \step
      Since $T_1$ and $T_2$ are both deciders, $T$ is always terminates
      with either \Accept or \Reject, and it only returns \Accept when both
      $T_1$ and $T_2$ accept the input so it is a decider for $L_1 \cap L_2$.
      \qed
    \end{Answer}

    \newpage
    \item complement
    \begin{Answer}
      Let $T$ be a TM deciding $L$.  Construct a TM $T'$ as follows:

      \step
      $T'$ = ``On input $w$:
        \begin{enumarabic}
          \item Simulate $T$ on input $w$.
          \item If $T$ accepts, \Reject;
                if $T$ rejects, \Accept.''
        \end{enumarabic}

      \step
      Since $T$ is a decider, $T'$ always terminates on any input string.
      Furthermore, $T'$ always disagrees with $T$ on any string ---
      if $T'$ accepts $w$, then $T$ rejects $w$ and vice versa,
      so $T$ is a decider for $\overline{L}$.  \qed
    \end{Answer}
    
    \setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item Kleene star
    \begin{Answer}
      Let $T$ be a TM deciding $L$.  Construct an NDTM $T'$ as follows:

      \step
      $T'$ = ``On input $w$:
        \begin{enumarabic}
          \item If $w = \eps$, \Accept.
          \item Insert a new symbol $\# \notin \Sigma$ before the first
                symbol of $w$.
          \item Simulate $T$ on the contents of $w$ before the $\#$ symbol.~\label{step:1.3.3}
          \item If $T$ rejects, then; if the the $\#$ symbol is not at the end
            of $w$, shift it by $1$ to the right and go to step~\ref{step:1.3.3}
          \item If $T$ accepts, non-deterministically choose one of the following
            two options:
            \begin{enumarabic*}
              \item Simulate $T'$ on the contents of $w$ after the $\#$ symbol.
                If $T'$ accepts, \Accept.
              \item Shift the $\#$ symbol by $1$ to the right and go to step~\ref{step:3}
            \end{enumarabic*}
        \end{enumarabic}

      \step
      $T'$ accepts an input $w$ under any of these scenarios:
      \begin{enumroman}
        \item $w = \eps$ or $w$ is a member of $L$.
        \item $w$ contains a prefix that is a member of $L$,
          and the remaining suffix is also accepted by $T'$.
      \end{enumroman}

      \step
      Therefore, if $T'$ accepts $w$, then (a) $w$ is empty or
      (b) by unwinding the recursion we can write
      $w = w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ where $w_i \in L$ for all $i$.
      This is the definition of $w$ being in $L^*$, so $T'$ is a decider
      for $L^*$.  \qed
    \end{Answer}
