\begin{problem}
  Prove that every infinite recognizable language has an infinite
  decidable subset.
  (If $L$ is an infinite recognizable subset, then there exists
  an infinite decidable language $L' \subseteq L$).\\
  \grey{Hint:
    Think of enumerator TMs and the results
    we proved in class about them.
  }
\end{problem}
\begin{Answer}
  Let $M$ be a TM recognizing a language $L$ over alphabet $\Sigma$. \\
  \crim{
    Note: I use the fact that  $\Sigma^*$ is decidable thus enumerable
    in lexicographic order to enumerate members of $\Sigma^*$ without
    going into the full details of the TM for this operation
    since we covered that in class.
  } \\
  First, construct an enumerator TM $E$ for a subset of the language $L$ as follows:

  \step
  $E$ = ``On input $\vector{M}$:
    \begin{enumarabic}
      \item $len \gets 0$.
      \item For $i \gets 1, 2, 3, \ldots$
        \begin{enumarabic*}
          \item Define $s_i$ to be the next string in the \crim{enumeration of $\Sigma^*$}.
          \item Define $S = \set{s \in \set{s_1, s_2, \ldots s_i} : \abs{s} > len}$.
          \item Simulate $M$ for $i$ steps on each $s \in S$.
          \item If $M$ accepts some $s_k \in S$
          \begin{enumarabic*}
            \item \List $s_k$
            \item $len \gets \abs{s_k}$''
          \end{enumarabic*}
        \end{enumarabic*}
    \end{enumarabic}

  \begin{claim}
    There exists a language $L' \subseteq L$ such that $L'$ is infinite and decidable.
    
    \begin{proof}
      Let $L' = \set{w \in L : w \text{ is listed by } E}$.

      \step
      First, note that $L$ is infinite, so $L'$ also has to be infinite since,
      for any length $l$, $E$ can always list another string $s \in \Sigma^*$
      of length greater than $l$.
      Additionally, $\Sigma^*$ is enumerated in lexicographic order,
      so the sequence of strings listed by $E$ does not change
      across different runs of $E$.
      Thus, $L'$ is decidable by the following TM:

      \step
      $T$ = ``On input $w$:
        \begin{enumarabic}
          \item Simulate $E$ on input $\vector{M}$. \quad \crim{(where $M$ is the original TM for $L$)}
          \item If $E$ lists $w$, \Accept.
          \item The moment $E$ lists a string $w'$ such that $\abs{w'} \geq \abs{w}$, \Reject.
        \end{enumarabic}
        $T$ will always terminate with either \Accept or \Reject.
    \end{proof}
  \end{claim}
\end{Answer}
